Raw quantitative PCR data for passive eDNA study of _C. tumulosa_

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) data includes separate files for each methods comparison (all passive methods, passive vs. active, substrate cotton vs. MCE):

* **quantification amplification results for passive methods only** (2qPCR_data_merged.csv) - raw qPCR data used to visualize amplification curves (cycle number, relative fluorescence units "value", detection threshold as calculated by the CFX96 and efficiency "E", as calculated using the CFX Manager software) merged with sample metadata
* * **quantification amplification results for passive vs. active comparison** (2qPCR_data_merged_method.csv) - raw qPCR data used to visualize amplification curves (cycle number, relative fluorescence units "value", detection threshold as calculated by the CFX96 and efficiency "E", as calculated using the CFX Manager software) merged with sample metadata
* **quantification amplification results for passive substrate comparison** (2qPCR_data_merged_substrate.csv) - raw qPCR data used to visualize amplification curves (cycle number, relative fluorescence units "value", detection threshold as calculated by the CFX96 and efficiency "E", as calculated using the CFX Manager software) merged with sample metadata

* **quantification Cq results for passive methods** (2Cq_data_merged.csv) - raw qPCR detection data used for modeling of site occupancy (quantification cycle Cq, detection threshold as calculated by the CFX96, efficiency "E", as calculated using the CFX Manager software, efficiency-corrected eDNA starting quantities "SQ.E") merged with sample metadata

Project metadata is provided in each and includes site IDs, date of sample collection, region, island, site depth (meters), *Chondria tumulosa* percent benthic cover from visual surveys (%), and GPS coordinates (Lat./Long.).
